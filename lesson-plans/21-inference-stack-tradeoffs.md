# 21. Latency, quality, cost, reliability tradeoffs across the full inference stack — Lesson-Plan Breakdown

**Slug:** `inference-stack-tradeoffs` · **Depth:** light draft · See [Goals.md](../Goals.md) · [TOPIC_PLANS.md](../TOPIC_PLANS.md)

**Scope:** The system-level, integrative view: every layer (routing, caching, batching,
quantization, retrieval, decoding) trades among latency, quality, cost, and reliability.

## Expert Surface (light — living; verify before authoring)
- **Concepts:** the four-way tradeoff; per-layer dominant axes; SLOs as anchor; end-to-end budgets; reliability as first-class; second-order interactions.
- **Key terms:** SLO/SLA, latency/cost budget decomposition, Pareto frontier, goodput, tail latency, redundancy cost.
- **Tradeoffs:** the whole point — batching↑throughput/↑latency; quant↓cost/↓quality; fallback↑reliability/↑cost; etc.
- **Patterns:** SLO-anchored design; budget decomposition; measure-then-optimize. **Antipatterns:** single-metric optimization; "free lunch" claims; premature optimization; ignoring reliability cost.
- **Architectures:** end-to-end serving stack; capacity/SLO planning.
- **Papers/posts:** roofline/serving analyses; FrugalGPT; production LLM system write-ups (Anthropic/OpenAI/company blogs). *(verify)*
- **People/canon:** serving-systems researchers; production practitioners; Chip Huyen (systems).
- **Benchmarks/metrics:** TTFT/TPOT, tokens/sec, $/task, availability, p99 latency, quality evals — viewed jointly.
- **Tools/OSS/models:** vLLM/TensorRT-LLM/SGLang; load-testing harnesses; eval + cost + obs stacks combined.
- **Open problems:** joint multi-objective optimization; predictable SLOs under load; interaction effects.
- **Interview signals:** can you reason about a change's effect on all four axes and anchor on SLOs.
